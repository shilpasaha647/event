        <p>
          According to Wikipedia event management is "the application of project
          management to the creation and development of large-scale events such
          as festivals, conferences, ceremonies, weddings, formal parties,
          concerts and conventions" which sounds reasonable if a little
          long-winded. There are a number of important things an event
          management company does, some obvious and others less so. A good event
          company will provide a range of resources and services as well as
          highly experienced personnel who can ensure the smooth running of the
          event, whether large or small.

        </h3>
        <p>
        Hiring a company to manage your event can seem expensive but good event management companies will have a range 
        of event equipment as well as regular contact with trusted suppliers, performers, 
        venues and technicians. As a result they can get better deals on anything you may need, 
        and probably get it more quickly.
